## What is this?

This is a little physics simulation which uses time-dilation to create gravitational attraction. The interesting part of the simulation is, it's able to create gravity by "bending" time, but not space; the internal forces of the orbiting body create a net pull towards the point where time moves slowest. [I explain it a bit better in the talk.](https://youtu.be/wGB5AYvFjxE?t=7628)
